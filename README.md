# NDR (Network Detection and Response) 
The NDR system, based on MMT (Montimage Monitoring Tool) and MAIP (Montimage AI Platform), will provide advanced capabilities for network traffic analysis, detection of anomalies, and response to potential cybersecurity threats. NDR offers robust machine learning frameworks designed specifically for anomaly detection, leveraging both traditional models and state-of-the-art AI techniques. The integration of MAIP into the NDR system will enable dynamic, real-time analysis, optimizing both detection accuracy and response efficiency.
